# Anti GPT Captcha
a CAPTCHA, which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, is a security measure designed to differentiate between human users and automated bots or software. It typically consists of a challenge or puzzle that is easy for humans to solve but difficult for machines to crack, thereby preventing bots from performing automated actions that could be harmful or disruptive.

CAPTCHAs are used on websites and online applications to prevent automated bots from performing actions such as spamming forms, creating multiple accounts, conducting brute force attacks, or scraping data. They are commonly used in online forms, user registration processes, online voting systems, and online ticket purchasing systems, among other applications.

There are various types of CAPTCHAs, including image-based CAPTCHAs where users need to identify and select specific objects or characters from an image, text-based CAPTCHAs where users need to type in distorted or obscured characters, and behavioral-based CAPTCHAs where users need to perform specific actions such as dragging and dropping objects or solving puzzles.

CAPTCHAs are useful in safeguarding online systems and protecting user privacy by preventing automated bots from exploiting vulnerabilities or abusing online resources. They help ensure that actions performed on websites and applications are carried out by human users, reducing the risk of fraud, spam, and other malicious activities. However, CAPTCHAs can also be a source of inconvenience for users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities, and efforts are being made to develop more accessible alternatives.
